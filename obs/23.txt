Malis raug qhaib rau ib tug txivneej ncajncees npe hu ua Yauxej. Thaum Yauxej hnov tias Malis xeeb menyuam, nws paub tias tsis yog nws li. Nws tsis xav ua kom Malis txajmuag, yog li nws npaj nrauj Malis twjywm. Uantej nws ua tau li ntawd, ib tug timtswv los thiab hais rau nws hauv ib zaj npau-suav.

Tus timtswv hais tias, “Yauxej, tsis txhob ntshai coj Malis los ua koj pojniam. Tus menyuam uas nws muaj yog los ntawm tus Ntsujplig Dawbhuv. Nws yuav yug ib tug tub. Tis nws npe hu ua Yexus (uas txhais tias, 'Ya-ves cawm'), rauqhov nws yuav cawm nws cov neeg ntawm lawv tej kev txhaum."

Yog li Yauxej yuav Malis thiab coj nws mus tsev ua nws pojniam, tiamsis Yauxej tsis nrog nws pw mus txog thaum nws yug tau tus metub.

When the time was near for Mary to give birth, the Roman government told everyone to go for a census to the town where their ancestors had lived. Joseph and Mary had to make a long journey from where they lived in Nazareth to Bethlehem because their ancestor was David whose hometown was Bethlehem.

When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place to stay. The only room they could find was a place where animals stayed. The baby was born there and his mother laid him in a feeding trough, since they did not have a bed for him. They named him Jesus.

That night, there were some shepherds in a nearby field guarding their flocks. Suddenly, a shining angel appeared to them, and they were terrified. The angel said, “Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Bethlehem!”

“Go search for the baby, and you will find him wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding trough.” Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels praising God, saying, “Glory to God in heaven and peace on earth to the people he favors!”

The shepherds soon arrived at the place where Jesus was and they found him lying in a feeding trough, just as the angel had told them. They were very excited. The shepherds returned to the fields where their sheep were, praising God for all they had heard and seen.

Sometime later, wise men from countries far to the east saw an unusual star in the sky. They realized it meant a new king of the Jews had been born. So, they traveled a great distance to see this king. They came to Bethlehem and found the house where Jesus and his parents were staying.

When the wise men saw Jesus with his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They gave Jesus expensive gifts. Then they returned home.
